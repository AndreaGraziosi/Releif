**** FIX UI/UX!!!!!

- ***Removing all unused code
delete unused and unfinished code (for example, files containing CSV information that was not used, HTML templates not being used, etc..)

- ***Getting to know the program by running the features and adding comments to the code\
----comment the code

- ***Write tests for existing methods, so that all functions pass
--- figure out how to do this. so that program does not crash

- ***No new features 
although I wanted to add a user and database component so that users could save favorite sequences and create new sequences by adding poses and pictures. this can be developed after the refactoring is done.

- ***Improve naming 
make sure the plural form and singular form of the variables are being used correctly

- ***Improve documentation
document the changes and explain what each class does, what methods can be called for. 

-*** Implement code classes
-------instead of having dictionaries and a bunch of separate methods to extracting information from those JSON or dictionary items,  I could make a class called Sequences with attributes: poses, ailments the pose helps with, and sequence title.
The methods in this class would be getPoses(), returns Poses; GetSequences(): returns Sequences:  getAilments():returns ailments affecting a body
the next class could be get Class Poses:
here attributes could be: Pose name, pose instructions, and pose picture
Methods(): getPose():, returns a pose name; get pictures: returns pose pictures: getInstructions() returns instructions
